        <h1>Ordering Guidelines</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Please read these guidelines carefully before placing an order. They
          explain stock status, item conditions, discounts, how ordering works,
          and what happens if you need to change or cancel an order.
        </p>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All items are authentic Bandai scale world 1/20 (unless otherwise
            specified), imported from Japan. You can verify markings even on the
            smallest Pokemon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most images will be reference images because actual products are in
            poly bags and I am too lazy to photograph them. I can send you real
            pictures before completing the order.
          </li>
          <li>
            All items are in stock; none of them require booking or waiting.
          </li>
          <li>
            All items are authentic Bandai scale world 1/20 (unless otherwise
            specified), imported from Japan.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a small chance something is sold out but still listed. I
            will let you know before accepting payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many of these are single stock, so do not hesitate too much or you
            will miss out.
          </li>
          <li>
            I generally do not accept requests like “bring me X or Y”. I can
            note your interest and let you know if I end up bringing it; the
            price may or may not be the same.
          </li>
          <li>
            I can discard boxes if you do not need them but still want mint
            condition products.
          </li>
          <li>
            I can sell you specific Pokémon from a set, but that will cost
            extra.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Item conditions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Missing Accessory</strong> – Sometimes, items might be
            missing a base or another accessory and they will be priced
            accordingly. Many of them work fine without them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open</strong> – The item does not have outer packaging, like
            a poly bag or a box. It has most likely been displayed before. These
            are generally in good or excellent condition, but if there are any
            scratches or marks I will mention them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sealed</strong> – The item is still in manufacturer
            packaging, but without a box. It has never been displayed before.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Boxed</strong> – The item comes with a box. Whether it has
            been opened before will be separately mentioned. In most cases it
            will be sealed too.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Discounts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Discounts are generally only possible if you place a large order and
            order a good ratio of trainers and Pokémon.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are special offers for artists and people involved in the
            anime community (for example, show me your cosplay or art, such as
            an Instagram page).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to order</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            DM me on WhatsApp with the number or name on the product cards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Private delivery only as of now. It can take up to 7–10 days to ship
            based on your order size and my availability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Order restrictions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Minimum order amount is 2500. Shipping will be divided between us
            and it will be nominal.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the order has been paid for but not packed:
            <ul>
              <li>More items can be added free of charge.</li>
              <li>Items can be removed as long as you are reasonable.</li>
              <li>
                Cancelling the order is possible as long as you do not keep
                changing your mind.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the order has been packed but not shipped yet:
            <ul>
              <li>No new items can be added.</li>
              <li>
                The order can be cancelled as a whole by paying a 10% fee of the
                entire order value.
              </li>
              <li>
                Individual items can be removed by paying 10% of their value.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The fee gets deducted from your refund value in the above cases. For
            repeat customers, I am more flexible.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the order has been shipped, it is not possible to make any
            changes or cancel.
          </li>
          <li>No returns if you change your mind.</li>
          <li>
            In case of issues like missing, damaged, or incorrect items, an
            uncut unboxing video is required, and a refund will be issued. A
            return may or may not be required.
          </li>
          <li>
            No COD; 100% payment will be upfront.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you want, I can send you proof that I have no motivation or
                need to scam, but that is the most I can do.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
