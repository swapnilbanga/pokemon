        <h1>Ordering Guidelines</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          Please read these guidelines carefully before placing an order. They
          explain stock status, item conditions, discounts, how ordering works,
          and what happens if you need to change or cancel an order.
        </p>
        <h2>How to order</h2>

          <li>
            Private delivery only as of now. It can take up to 7–10 days to ship
            based on your order size so please be patient.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All items are authentic Bandai scale world 1/20 (unless otherwise
            specified), bought from Japan. You can verify markings even on the
            smallest Pokemon.
          </li>
          <li>
            More pictures or real pictures (in case the catalog has reference
            image) can be shared upon request.
          </li>
          <li>All items are in stock unless otherwise specified.</li>
          <li>
            There is a small chance something is sold out but still listed. We
            will let you know before accepting payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many of these are single or limited stock, so do not hesitate too
            much or you will miss out.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can discard boxes if you do not need them but still want mint
            condition products.
          </li>
          <li>
            We can sell you specific Pokémon from a set being sold, but that
            will be at a premium.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Item conditions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Missing Accessory/No Base</strong> – Items with missing
            accessories are priced accordingly. Many of them work fine without
            them. We can send you a video upon request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loose</strong> – The item does not have outer packaging,
            like a poly bag or a box. It has most likely been displayed before.
            We will mention any scratches or marks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sealed</strong> – The item is still in manufacturer
            packaging (plastic bag), but without a box. It has never been
            displayed before.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Box (opened)</strong> – The item comes with a box, but has
            previously been opened and likely displayed. More details will be
            provided in the notes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Box (unopened)</strong> – The box may have been opened to
            verify the contents, but the items are still in a sealed plastic
            bag.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Discounts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Discounts are available on billing of multiple items. Your best
            offer will be shared with you on inquiry. There will also be limited
            time deals, auctions and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are special offers for artists and people involved in the
            anime community (show us your cosplay or art, such as an Instagram
            page).
          </li>
        </ul>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Individual items can be removed by paying 10% of their value.

          </li>
          <li>
            If the order has been shipped, it is not possible to make any
            changes or cancel.
          </li>
          <li>No returns if you change your mind.</li>
          <li>
            In case of issues like missing, damaged, or incorrect items, an
            uncut unboxing video is required, and a refund will be issued. A
            return may or may not be required.
          </li>
          <li>
            No COD; 100% payment will be upfront. If you are worried about
            scams, please share your concern.
